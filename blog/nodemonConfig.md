# 1. Config nodemon

  ```json
  {
      "watch": ["src"],
      "ext": ".ts,.js",
      "exec": "ts-node ./src/index.ts"
  }
  ```

  This is a **`nodemon.json` configuration file** that customizes **Nodemon's behavior** for your
  project. It defines what files to watch, which file extensions to monitor, and what command to
  execute when files change.

  Let’s break it down line-by-line:

  ---

# 2. **1. `"watch": ["src"]`**

- This tells Nodemon to **watch** the `src` directory for changes.
- Whenever any file inside the `src` folder (or its subdirectories) changes, Nodemon will restart
  the specified process.

# 3. **What It Does:**

- Monitors the `src` folder recursively for file changes.
- Only files or folders listed in the `watch` array will be tracked.

# 4. **Example:**

  If a file like `src/index.ts` or `src/utils/helper.ts` is modified, Nodemon will restart the
  process.

  ---

# 5. **2. `"ext": ".ts,.js"`**

- Specifies the **file extensions** that Nodemon should monitor for changes.
- In this case, Nodemon is watching files with the `.ts` and `.js` extensions.

# 6. **How It Works:**

- **`.ts`**: Nodemon will restart the process if a TypeScript file (`.ts`) changes.
- **`.js`**: It also restarts the process if a JavaScript file (`.js`) changes.

# 7. **Why Combine `.ts` and `.js`?**

- This is useful in projects where both TypeScript (`.ts`) and compiled JavaScript (`.js`) files
  coexist.
- For example:
  - You might be writing TypeScript code, but some parts of the project still rely on JavaScript.
  - Or, you might be debugging compiled `.js` files generated by TypeScript.

# 8. **Example Change Triggers:**

- `src/index.ts` → Restart.
- `src/app.js` → Restart.

  ---

 1.2.3.0.3. **3. `"exec": "ts-node ./src/index.ts"`**

- Specifies the **command to execute** when Nodemon restarts the process.

# 9. **What It Does:**

- Runs the `ts-node` command on the `./src/index.ts` file.
- **`ts-node`**:
  - A tool that allows you to directly execute TypeScript files without compiling them to
    JavaScript first.
  - It compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in-memory and runs it immediately.
- **`./src/index.ts`**:
  - This is the entry point of your application (likely a `ts` file, but the path might be
    incorrect; see below).

# 10. **Why Use `ts-node`?**

- It allows you to run TypeScript files directly, without needing to manually compile them to
  JavaScript using `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler).
- Great for development workflows where you want rapid iteration.

# 11. **Putting It All Together**

  Here’s what this configuration does:

  1. **Watch the `src` directory**:
     - Nodemon monitors all files in `src` and its subdirectories.
  2. **Restart on `.ts` or `.js` file changes**:
     - Nodemon restarts the process whenever a file with the `.ts` or `.js` extension is modified.
  3. **Execute `ts-node`**:
     - When a file change is detected, Nodemon runs the `ts-node` command to execute
     `./src/index.ts` (or the equivalent entry point).

  ---

# 12. **How the Workflow Looks**

  1. You start Nodemon using:

     ```bash
     nodemon
     ```

  2. Nodemon watches the `src` folder for changes.
  3. If any `.ts` or `.js` file in `src` changes, Nodemon:
     - Stops the currently running process.
     - Executes the following command to restart it:

       ```bash
       ts-node ./src/index.ts
       ```

  4. The TypeScript file is compiled on-the-fly and executed.

  ---

 1.2.3.0.6. **Example Use Case**

  This configuration is ideal for a **TypeScript project** where:

- You are actively developing in TypeScript (`.ts`) files.
- You want to directly run TypeScript code using `ts-node` without pre-compiling it to JavaScript.
- You might also have some `.js` files in your project (e.g., legacy code or external scripts)
  that you want to track.

  ---

# 13. Changes Made

  1. **Corrected the `exec` path**: Points to `index.ts`, the likely entry file.
  2. **Simplified `ext`**: Changed to `ts,js` instead of `.ts.js` for better readability.

  ---

# 14. **Conclusion**

  This `nodemon.json` helps streamline the development process for a TypeScript project by:

- Automatically restarting the application whenever `.ts` or `.js` files in the `src` folder
  change.
- Leveraging `ts-node` to avoid pre-compiling TypeScript files, saving time during development.

  By ensuring the correct configuration, you'll have a smoother TypeScript development workflow!
